Welcome to my personal blog!

I started writing this just as a way to leave record of the things I use and play with, consolidate my knowledge, and get some practice in writing. I'm not used to writing things really, but I expect the quality improve over time.

In this modern era we're running, where new things come out constantly, and languages, frameworks and tools, all evolves very quickly, it is hard to keep on track on everything. It's easy to loose yourself in this vast ocean, and without a method to systematically arrange that knowledge, some things could be forgotten. So having a blog aids in some point by letting me organize this stuff. 

This blog is also a great opportunity to put my hands on things I've only heard of, but never made myself. Just to mention a few: configure a DNS, use Google Analytics (yes I'm using it, keep reading), the SEO thing, and worry for a responsive design ("worry" as in "not breaking it", 'cause the template I've used is already responsive).

Now, talking about the technology stack I choose for the blog, I ended with [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/nelsonghezzi/nelsonghezzi.github.io) + [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll home page"). As a developer who works in web apps, I'm used to templating systems, and kinda like them. This gives me a degree of flexibility to shape the site's content in the way I want, while preserving the hability to make custom pages, and Jekyll has that (powered by the [Liquid Library](http://liquidmarkup.org/ "Liquid home page")).

I'm the kind of guy who likes to know how things work and do them himself, and that's also why I skip "canned" alternatives, like Blogger or WordPress (which I'm not saying are bad, certainly they're very powerful platforms, but I just want to get my hands a little dirty).

I'm still making baby steps with some part of the setup, reading the docs and seeing what others do with it (and how they do it, as it's all in public GitHub repos, which is great for a newcomer).

I'm no sure yet about adding a commenting system. Yes, it'll be nice to let people write comments, but the only option I've seen so far is putting comments on some platform like Disqus. Disqus seems a good platform, indeed, but I dislike the idea that commentors need to have an account to get the chance of express an opinion. I'm constructing this from free services, so requiring such thing simply doesn't fit for me.

I'm also usign Google Analytics to get some statistics of what's going on on the site. Not that I'm expecting a huge traffic that must be analyzed, but maybe it throws up some interesting numbers. I thought if visitors would like this, as someone might take it as a privacy concern, but all in all, every blog needs and use some type of counting mechanism, so for that purpose is not a bad thing (and also think in all the sites you've visited that already uses it, so if you're cool with them, then you should be cool with mine :P).

The site is far from finished. The lack of content is my primary concern, but it's just a matter of time to push stuff into it. I want also to improve a bit the design, yet I'm not a skilled designer, so probably that is something I'll do from time to time.

Well, here ends this brief introduction to my blog. I hope it's useful for someone in the near future. For me, it already has.

See ya!
