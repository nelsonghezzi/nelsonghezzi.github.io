A long, long time ago, in a cyber-galaxy far, far away... there were a blog... my blog. A short-lived one, which soon was forgotten in this ever-growing cyberspace.

With all the pieces assembled, the machinery only needed the fuel of time to start spinning, but as you know, time is a scarce resource this days. Hope the day will come, where minutes or hours can be bought!  

Believing that I've identified the key point of my failure, I can move on in arranging a different strategy for this to work the way I expect. Plus, I'm  forced to renew this not-free-anymore domain, so I say 'hey, if I'm paying, make it worthwhile'.

This year I will try to write more posts (one per week at least), but on very concrete things. No large reviews or step-by-step tutorials, and more linking to other resources for context information. If some topic gets interesting, it'll be broken into a series of smaller posts.

And this first writing of the year is not exempt of being short and focused, so it is coming to an end. Two more posts are in the backlog, they should be committed soon.

All said, controls set, flaps checked. Let's write.
